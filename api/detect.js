// useful to a rep reading it, useless to a renderer. This one returns located
// findings — a box, a severity and a short label per defect — so the app can
// draw a circle on top of the photograph.
//
// THE CIRCLES ARE AN OVERLAY, NEVER BURNED IN. This route touches no pixels
// and returns no image. The app renders boxes over the original, which means
// the photograph on file is never altered — the whole reason auto-annotation
// is safe to run on roofs that end up in insurance claims. Anything that later
// flattens a circle into a JPEG is doing something different, and should only
// ever do it to a copy made for presentation.
//
// NOTHING HERE REACHES A HOMEOWNER UNREVIEWED. This is a suggestion engine.
// A person accepts, adjusts or rejects every finding before it is shown.

   `severity` is NOT a new scale. It is the existing crit/warn/ok used by
   severityOf() and api/sortphotos.js, which the report already renders as
   HIGH / MODERATE / MONITOR and which matches the three tiers in Theo's
   brief: Severe (replace) / Moderate (repair) / Minor (monitor). A fourth
   scale under a colliding name is the failure this project keeps paying for.

   `defect` IS new — nothing in the app localises damage today, so there is no
   prior art to match. It must be mirrored client-side before anything reads
   it: a value this route can emit that the client does not know silently
   becomes something else on the other side.

  /* ── 17-30: the exterior half, added 5 Aug 2026; narrowed 602 ────────────
     THESE KEYS ARE A CONTRACT AND THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. They are
     exterior_vocab.py on Theo's Spark, verbatim — the same file
     prepare_yolo.py and recover_other.py import, so DEFECT_KEYS is index-
     aligned with the trained model's class indices 0-30. `other` stays at 16
     for that reason, not because an escape hatch belongs mid-list. Renaming or
     reordering silently decouples this route from the model.

     They are not invented. They are the clusters of what the model ACTUALLY
     called the 294 boxes a roof-only vocabulary had to flatten to 'other'
     (gutter 65, soffit/fascia 57, window 42, deck 42), and they map onto the
     six trades in walks_trade_ck with no seventh trade needed.

     602: soffit_damage and fascia_damage MERGED back to one key, and
     paint_deterioration REMOVED. The cluster line above is the reason —
     the boxes grouped as 'soffit/fascia 57', one cluster, and splitting
     them into two classes is what let the model spread confidence across
     both. NMS is per-class, so neither suppressed the other and the same
     eave came back boxed three or four times. paint_deterioration was a
     CONDITION among LOCATIONS — it stacked on every surface — so paint
     failure now belongs to whichever surface carries it, and is named in
     both descriptions above so the model still has somewhere to put it.
     33 -> 31 classes. Every index <= 18 is unchanged; the roof half and
     `other` keep their numbers. */
