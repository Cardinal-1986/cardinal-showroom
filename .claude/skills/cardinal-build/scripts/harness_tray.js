/* Builds 627–628 — the Studio tray, both ends.

   627 shipped one tray. 628 split it in two (before/after vs theirs-vs-ours)
   and gave the Hall of Fame the picker it never had.

   The assertion that matters most is still the GPS one. studio_photos carries
   lat/lon (all NULL today), and this is the first path from the archive toward
   a CLIENT-FACING screen. A spread of the source row — `{...r}` — would carry
   coordinates across the seam the whole Vision suite was fenced to keep closed.
   Adding a bucket does not change that. Named fields only, asserted at source,
   in both files.

   real CI run found it in 27 seconds: harness_tray reads three .sql files by
