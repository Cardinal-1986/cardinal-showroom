/* gate_983.mjs — the typography fix, everywhere else (build 983).

   980 repaired the 30 invalid `font:<weight> <size> inherit` declarations in
   Community. 983 finishes the other 64. `inherit` is a CSS-wide keyword: legal
   as an entire value, never as one component of a shorthand — so the browser
   discards the WHOLE declaration, weight and size with it.

   ⚠ THREE SHAPES, and only the first is obvious:
   · 56 stylesheet rules            `font:700 13px inherit`
   · 6 INLINE style= attributes     inside JS-generated markup — which is why no
                                    stylesheet check ever caught them
   · 2 via an UNDECLARED TOKEN      `font:700 13px var(--lb-sans,inherit)`.
                                    That form is VALID when the token exists —
                                    proved in Chromium — but `--lb-sans` has 0
                                    declarations and 2 references, so both fell
                                    back to `inherit` and failed identically.

     1  zero invalid declarations remain anywhere in the file
     2  ...counted on comment-stripped source, and the count fell by exactly 64
     3  the Showcase's 25 were included — the largest cluster and client-facing
     4  the six inline attributes were repaired, and their scripts still parse
     5  the --lb-sans pair was repaired, and no reference to that undeclared
        token survives
     6  no font-family was invented anywhere — the repair is weight/size only
     7  RENDER: every converted rule survives Chromium's parse
     8  ...and that check CAN fail — restore the invalid form and it goes red

   Usage: node gate_983.mjs [path] — previous build = negative control; must go
   RED with named failures and MUST NOT crash (BUG_CLASSES 37). */
