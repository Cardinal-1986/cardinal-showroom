/* Build 630 — "Our roofs in this colour": multi-upload, shrink, delete, lightbox.

   Theo reported six things from the iPad on the Onyx Black page. TWO OF THEM
   SHARE ONE ROOT CAUSE, and that is what this harness mostly guards:

     storage.buckets.photos.file_size_limit = 10 MB, and upload() sent RAW
     camera bytes. The six photos already on that page are 5.37–8.04 MB each,
     so bigger ones were REFUSED ("upload fails") and the survivors made the
     grid ~40 MB to paint ("scrolling locks up").

   The fix is the mechanism that already existed in cr-show-script. If a future
   build re-introduces a raw upload here, or copies shrink() instead of reusing
   it, these assertions are what should go red.

   633 added a THIRD rendition and this harness moved with it. The tile is
   ~270 CSS px and was loading the 1400px DISP copy — five times more image than
   it can show. THUMB (640px) is what the grid asks for now, with a three-level
   fallback so a photo from any era still renders.
