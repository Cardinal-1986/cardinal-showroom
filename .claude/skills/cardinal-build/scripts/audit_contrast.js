/* CONTRAST AUDIT — every text node, measured in a real engine.
 *
 * Written at 623, when OC Colors went from Blackout to Owens Corning's white
 * panels and 25 text nodes fell below their WCAG floor. Eyes caught two of the
 * 25. This caught all of them, including #231F20 ink on a #171415 card at
 * 1.12:1 that no screenshot made obvious.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody trusts it too far: it resolves
 * backgroundCOLOR up the ancestor chain, so text over a background-IMAGE is
 * measured against whatever colour sits beneath the photo. A "failure" on a
 * photo card may be the audit's blind spot — but it is still worth reading,
 * because it tells you what the text would land on if the image never loaded.
 *
 * Usage: node audit_contrast.js        (reads the live index.html)
 *
 * Originally build 618's harness. Two jobs jsdom cannot do:
   1. prove the three styles actually lay out differently above 820px, and
   2. prove the PHONE IS UNTOUCHED — pixel-identical across all three styles
      and against the build-617 baseline. */

   they stood at 616) and final/*.jpg (the cover images). Point CR_OCC_FIXTURES

/* ✅ THE FIXTURES ARE COMMITTED NOW, AND THIS NO LONGER SELF-DISABLES.
   It needed `$CR_OCC_FIXTURES/rows616.json` and `final/*.jpg` — a scratchpad
   that was never committed — so it exited 2 with an honest "NOT RUN" and had
   audited nothing for a very long time. An audit that cannot run is not a
   safety net; it is a comment.

   ⚠ THE ROWS WERE NOT INVENTED. harness_colors already carried a real-shaped
   `oc_colors` set, documented as "verbatim proportions from the live table".
   That set is now fixtures/oc_colors_rows.json and BOTH gates read it, so they
   cannot drift into disagreeing about what the table looks like.

   ⚠ THE COVER IMAGES ARE DELIBERATELY TRIVIAL, and that is sound rather than
   lazy: this audit resolves a text node's ground by walking backgroundCOLOR up
   its ancestors, so a photograph never enters the arithmetic — its own header
   says so. The covers exist only so a card lays out as it does in production.
   A photo-realistic fixture would change nothing it measures. */
