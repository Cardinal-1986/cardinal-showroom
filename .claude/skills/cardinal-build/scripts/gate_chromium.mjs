/* gate_chromium.mjs — the four Chromium gates, in CI, each with a negative control.
 *
 * WHY THESE FOUR WERE OUTSIDE CI. They drive a real browser, and until now the
 * repo had no CI job that installed one. Three of them also hard-coded a browser
 * path inside the sandbox they were written in, and one had self-disabled for
 * months over fixtures that were never committed. So "not covered" understated
 * it: two of the four could not have run anywhere but one machine.
 *
 * ⚠ ALL FOUR ARE GREEN ON THE SHIPPED FILE, SO THERE IS NO BASELINE HERE, AND
 * THAT IS DELIBERATE. gate_harnesses carries a debt register because four of its
 * six are legitimately red; these four are not. The honest ratchet is zero, and
 * a baseline file would only be somewhere for a future failure to hide.
 *
 * ⚠ WHICH MAKES THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS THE WHOLE VALUE. Four gates that have only
 * ever been seen to pass prove nothing — this project has shipped a gate
 * incapable of failing more than once. Each gate here is run a second time
 * against a DELIBERATELY BROKEN copy of the artifact, targeting the specific
 * thing that gate exists to protect, and is required to go red.
 *
 * Usage: node gate_chromium.mjs [index.html]
 *        node gate_chromium.mjs --selftest
