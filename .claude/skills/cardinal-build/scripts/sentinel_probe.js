  /* ⚠ A BORDER-BOX LAYER IS NOT A GROUND FOR TEXT — the gradient-BORDER idiom.
     Found 25 Aug 2026 producing ten false INK failures on Cardinal Truth, a
     screen the build log already records as rendering perfectly.

     The idiom, straight off .cr-cth-owed:
        background-image: linear-gradient(160deg, #faf8f7, #fff),   <- the FILL
                          linear-gradient(125deg, #c4180f, #7e1410) <- the BORDER
        background-clip:  padding-box, border-box

     Layer 1 clips to padding-box and is the card's fill. Layer 2 clips to
     border-box and paints ONLY the ring outside the padding edge. Text lives
     inside padding-box, so it never sits on layer 2 — but this function
     harvested every stop from every layer and the ink was scored against the
     red border. Measured: it reported 1.15:1 where the true value against the
     fill is 8.61:1.

     ⚠ The build log records this exact fault being fixed once already
     ("only layer 1, and skip it when it clips to border-box, 24 -> 0 on that
     screen"). No backgroundClip handling exists anywhere in this probe, so
     that fix is not here — it lived in a different rig and never made it into
     the standing one. Prose does not survive; a check does.

     Only skipped when some OTHER layer clips tighter. A lone border-box layer
     is an ordinary background (border-box is the CSS default) and must still

     The naive walk collects every colour an ancestor paints and scores the
     ink against each AS IF IT WERE OPAQUE. On this app that reported a
     perfectly readable label at 1.39:1, because .crow paints
     rgba(200,32,46,0.09) — a NINE PERCENT red wash over a dark panel. Nine
     percent red is not red. Treating it as red invents a failure, and an
     instrument that invents failures gets muted, which is worse than having
     no instrument at all.

     A translucent layer must be COMPOSITED over what is behind it. So: walk
     up until something opaque is found, then composite back down toward the
     element one layer at a time. A gradient contributes each of its stops as
     a separate candidate, because different parts of the element genuinely
     sit over different stops — the ink is then scored against the WORST
     candidate, never an average. */
